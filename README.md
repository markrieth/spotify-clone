### Requirements
Assumptions: 
We have a set of songs already created to pre-populate our system. 

Core:
1. As a listener, I want to retrieve a song, so that I can listen to it. 
2. As a listener, I want to retrieve a list of songs filtered by genre or album, so that I can play a collection of related songs.
3. As a listener, I want to create a playlist of songs, so that I can define a custom collection of songs across different genres and albums. 

Nice-to-haves:
4. As an artist, I want to create albums of songs, so that my listeners can retrieve and listen to them.
